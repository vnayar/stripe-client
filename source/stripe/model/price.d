/**
 * Prices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for both recurring and
 * one-time purchases of products.
 * [Products](https://stripe.com/docs/api#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and
 * prices help you track payment terms. Different physical goods or levels of service should be
 * represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by prices. This approach
 * lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.
 * For example, you might have a single "gold" product that has prices for $10/month, $100/year,
 * and â‚¬9 once.
 * Related guides: [Set up a
 * subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription), [create an
 * invoice](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/create), and more about [products and
 * prices](https://stripe.com/docs/products-prices/overview).
